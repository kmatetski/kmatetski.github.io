### About me

I am a Ritt Assistant Professor at the Mathematics Department of Columbia University. I obtained my Ph.D. in 2016 at the University of Warwick, UK. My research interests are

- stochastic PDEs, including regularity structures and rough paths,
- integrable probability and the KPZ universality,
- limiting behavior of interacting particle systems
